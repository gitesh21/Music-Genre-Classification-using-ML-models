# Music-Genre-Classification-using-ML-models
• I performed a comparative study on music genre classification using machine learning models as a part of my master's dissertation. I used the reliable GTZAN dataset as a foundational source for the purpose.
###
• For this project, SVM and k-NN were the two models I opted for the comparative study using a combination of features from GTZAN dataset.
